Single-Frame Vignetting Correction for Post-Stitched-Tile Im-aging using VISTAmap (VIgnetted Stitched-Tile Adjustment using Morphological Adaptive Processing)

Cite as: Anthony A. Fung, Ashley H. Fung, Zhi Li, Lingyan Shi, "Single-Frame Vignetting Correction for Post-Stitched-Tile Im-aging" Nanomaterials, 2025 

Instructions:
This was tested using:
13th Gen Intel(R) Core (TM) i9-13900H, 2600 Mhz, 14 Core(s), 20 Logical Processor(s)
64 GB DDR4 RAM
Windows 11 Pro

Simply press run, or section > run section to run an individual section 

Inputs are a single-frame (2D) stitched image, and optionally a binary mask image of the tissue (if not, the code will attempt to create a mask)
